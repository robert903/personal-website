      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI've learned a lot after creating my first website. I've really did a hard work to learn the basics, and now I can easily learn new framework or tech in a couple of days. And I'am really happy to have possibility to create something beautiful. <br> Take a look to see the difference -   <a href="/myfirstpage/">Link</a></p>
